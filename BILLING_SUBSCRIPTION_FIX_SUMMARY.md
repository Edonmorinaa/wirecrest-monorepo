# Billing Subscription Flow - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Completed

All phases of the billing subscription fix have been successfully implemented.

### Phase 1: Simplified Frontend Subscription Flow
**File**: `apps/dashboard/src/sections/account/account-billing-plan.jsx`

- ‚úÖ Removed `createTeamSubscription` import (no longer needed)
- ‚úÖ Changed new subscription flow to go directly to Stripe Checkout
- ‚úÖ Eliminated double subscription creation issue
- ‚úÖ Removed fallback to customer portal (simplified error handling)

**Impact**: Users on FREE tier now go straight to checkout without creating incomplete subscriptions.

### Phase 2: Removed Trial Period
**File**: `apps/dashboard/src/app/api/billing/checkout/route.ts`

- ‚úÖ Removed `trial_period_days: 14` from checkout session creation
- ‚úÖ Subscriptions now start immediately upon payment (no trial)

**Impact**: Clean subscription creation without trial complexity.

### Phase 3: Added Missing Webhook Handler
**File**: `packages/billing/src/billing-service.ts`

- ‚úÖ Added `customer.subscription.created` event handler
- ‚úÖ Added comprehensive logging for all webhook events
- ‚úÖ Improved debugging capabilities with emoji-prefixed log messages

**Impact**: New subscriptions from checkout are now properly synced to database.

### Phase 4: Fixed Tier Extraction from Stripe Metadata
**File**: `packages/billing/src/billing-service.ts`

- ‚úÖ Updated `syncSubscriptionToLocal` to extract tier from subscription price ID
- ‚úÖ Looks up `SubscriptionTierConfig` by `stripePriceId`
- ‚úÖ Properly populates all tier-related fields (includedSeats, enabledFeatures, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Added detailed logging for tier resolution

**Impact**: Subscriptions now correctly identify their tier and associated features.

### Phase 5: Fixed Payment Success Handler
**File**: `packages/billing/src/stripe-service.ts`

- ‚úÖ Updated `handlePaymentSucceeded` to fetch full subscription object
- ‚úÖ Uses `BillingService.syncSubscriptionToLocal` for proper tier extraction
- ‚úÖ Added logging for payment processing

**Impact**: When invoices are paid, subscriptions update to ACTIVE with correct tier information.

### Phase 6: Consolidated Webhook Handling
**File**: `apps/dashboard/src/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

- ‚úÖ Routes subscription/billing events to `BillingService`
- ‚úÖ Routes product events to `ProductWebhookHandler`
- ‚úÖ Single webhook endpoint handles all Stripe events
- ‚úÖ Fixed import order for linter compliance

### Phase 7: Updated Server Exports
**File**: `packages/billing/src/server-only.ts`

- ‚úÖ Added `BillingService` to server-only exports
- ‚úÖ Enables webhook endpoint to import BillingService

**Impact**: Proper module exports for server-side webhook handling.

### Phase 8: Database Schema Updates
**File**: `packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`

- ‚úÖ Added `stripePriceId` field to `SubscriptionTierConfig`
- ‚úÖ Added `stripeProductId` field to `SubscriptionTierConfig`
- ‚úÖ Added index on `stripePriceId` for performance
- ‚úÖ Schema pushed to database successfully

**Impact**: Tier configs can now be looked up by Stripe price ID efficiently.

### Phase 9: Removed Duplicate Webhook Endpoint
**File**: `apps/dashboard/src/app/api/webhooks/stripe-subscription/route.ts`

- ‚úÖ Deleted file completely
- ‚úÖ Consolidated all webhook handling into `/api/webhooks/stripe`

**Impact**: No confusion between multiple webhook endpoints.

## üîß Configuration Required

### 1. Update Stripe Tier Configurations

You need to populate the `stripePriceId` field in your existing tier configurations:

```sql
UPDATE "SubscriptionTierConfig" 
SET "stripePriceId" = 'price_xxxxx'  -- Your Stripe Price ID
WHERE "tier" = 'STARTER';

UPDATE "SubscriptionTierConfig" 
SET "stripePriceId" = 'price_yyyyy'  -- Your Stripe Price ID
WHERE "tier" = 'PROFESSIONAL';

UPDATE "SubscriptionTierConfig" 
SET "stripePriceId" = 'price_zzzzz'  -- Your Stripe Price ID
WHERE "tier" = 'ENTERPRISE';
```

### 2. Configure Stripe Webhook

In your Stripe Dashboard, configure the webhook endpoint:

**Endpoint URL**: `https://your-domain.com/api/webhooks/stripe`

**Events to Subscribe**:
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.created`
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.updated`
- ‚úÖ `customer.subscription.deleted`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.payment_succeeded`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.payment_failed`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.created`
- ‚úÖ `invoice.updated`
- ‚úÖ `checkout.session.completed`

**Important**: Remove or disable the old `/api/webhooks/stripe-subscription` endpoint if configured.

### 3. Environment Variables

Ensure these are set:
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

## üéØ New Subscription Flow

### Before (Problematic):
1. User clicks "Upgrade Plan"
2. ‚ùå Frontend calls `createTeamSubscription()` ‚Üí Creates incomplete subscription + open invoice
3. Frontend creates checkout session ‚Üí Creates ANOTHER subscription
4. User pays ‚Üí 2 subscriptions exist, one incomplete
5. Webhooks fire but tier is hardcoded as 'STARTER'

### After (Fixed):
1. User clicks "Upgrade Plan"
2. ‚úÖ Frontend directly creates checkout session (no intermediate subscription)
3. User pays in Stripe Checkout
4. Stripe sends `checkout.session.completed` webhook
5. Stripe sends `customer.subscription.created` webhook ‚Üí Synced with correct tier
6. Stripe sends `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook ‚Üí Confirms ACTIVE status
7. User returns to dashboard with success message

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Test New Subscription
- [ ] User on FREE tier clicks upgrade to STARTER
- [ ] Redirects to Stripe Checkout (no duplicate subscriptions)
- [ ] Complete test payment
- [ ] Returns to `/user/account/billing?success=true`
- [ ] Success message displays
- [ ] Subscription shows as ACTIVE
- [ ] Tier shows as STARTER (or selected tier)
- [ ] Features from tier config are enabled

### Test Webhooks
- [ ] Check logs for `customer.subscription.created` event
- [ ] Verify tier extraction logs show correct tier
- [ ] Check logs for `invoice.payment_succeeded` event
- [ ] Verify subscription status updated to ACTIVE

### Cleanup Existing Issues
- [ ] Click "Cleanup Incomplete" button in billing dashboard
- [ ] Verify incomplete subscriptions removed from Stripe
- [ ] Verify open invoices voided

## üìä Monitoring

Watch for these log patterns in your webhook endpoint:

```
üîî [Webhook] Received event: customer.subscription.created
üîç [Sync] Looking up tier config for price: price_xxxxx
‚úÖ [Sync] Found tier config: STARTER
üíæ [Sync] Upserting subscription for team abc123
‚úÖ [Sync] Successfully synced subscription for team abc123

üîî [Webhook] Received event: invoice.payment_succeeded
üí∞ [Payment] Payment succeeded for subscription: sub_xxxxx
üîÑ [Payment] Syncing subscription with tier metadata after payment success
‚úÖ [Payment] Successfully synced subscription after payment
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Subscription created but tier shows as FREE
**Solution**: Check that `stripePriceId` is populated in `SubscriptionTierConfig` table.

### Issue: Webhook events not processing
**Solution**: 
1. Verify webhook signature secret is correct
2. Check webhook endpoint is `/api/webhooks/stripe` (not stripe-subscription)
3. Check server logs for webhook errors

### Issue: Payment succeeded but status not updating
**Solution**: 
1. Check `invoice.payment_succeeded` webhook is subscribed
2. Verify BillingService is imported correctly in webhook endpoint

### Issue: Multiple incomplete subscriptions
**Solution**: 
1. Use "Cleanup Incomplete" button in dashboard
2. Or run cleanup endpoint: `POST /api/billing/cleanup-incomplete`
