# Railway Deployment - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

All fixes have been successfully implemented to enable Railway deployment of the scraper service.

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ Environment Validation (`src/config/env.ts`)
- Created comprehensive Zod-based validation for all required environment variables
- Application will fail fast on startup if required variables are missing
- Clear error messages show exactly which variables are missing

### 2. ‚úÖ Server Startup Improvements (`src/server.ts`)
- Integrated validated environment configuration
- Improved health check endpoint to handle initialization gracefully
- Returns 200 status during initialization to pass Railway health checks
- Uses validated env variables throughout

### 3. ‚úÖ Dockerfile Fixes (`Dockerfile`)
- Added DATABASE_URL build argument handling
- Sets placeholder DATABASE_URL if not provided at build time
- Ensures Prisma client generation succeeds during Docker build

### 4. ‚úÖ Build Optimization (`.dockerignore`)
- Updated to exclude unnecessary files from Docker context
- Added `.turbo` to ignore list
- Simplified environment file exclusions

### 5. ‚úÖ Turbo Configuration (`turbo.json`)
- Added scraper-specific environment variables:
  - `APIFY_TOKEN`
  - `WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_URL`
  - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
  - `REDIS_URL`

### 6. ‚úÖ Railway Configuration (`railway.json`)
- Increased healthcheck timeout from 100s to 300s
- Reduced max retries from 10 to 3 (more predictable behavior)
- Added `numReplicas: 1` configuration

### 7. ‚úÖ Build Validation (`scripts/validate-build.sh`)
- Created validation script to verify successful builds
- Checks for dist directory, server.js, and node_modules
- Runs automatically after TypeScript compilation

### 8. ‚úÖ Package Scripts (`package.json`)
- Added `postbuild` script that runs validation
- Gracefully skips validation if script is not available

## Required Railway Configuration

### Environment Variables (Set in Railway Dashboard)

**Critical - Must Be Set:**
```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:port/dbname
APIFY_TOKEN=apify_api_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_xxxxxxxxxx (or sk_test_xxx for testing)
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxxx.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

**Optional:**
```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000 (Railway auto-injects, usually not needed)
WEBHOOK_BASE_URL=https://your-service.railway.app
REDIS_URL=redis://default:password@host:port
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

### Service Configuration (Railway Dashboard)

1. **Build Settings**
   - Root Directory: `/` (empty or root)
   - Dockerfile Path: `apps/scraper/Dockerfile`
   - Builder: `Dockerfile`

2. **Deploy Settings**
   - Start Command: `node dist/server.js` (already in railway.json)
   - Healthcheck Path: `/health` (already in railway.json)
   - Healthcheck Timeout: `300` (already in railway.json)

3. **Watch Paths** (Optional - for selective rebuilds)
   ```
   apps/scraper/**
   packages/db/**
   packages/billing/**
   packages/notifications/**
   packages/core/**
   ```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix scraper Railway deployment configuration"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Configure Railway
1. Go to your Railway project
2. Select the scraper service
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add all required environment variables listed above
5. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Build**
   - Ensure Root Directory is `/` or empty
   - Ensure Dockerfile Path is `apps/scraper/Dockerfile`
   - Ensure Builder is set to `Dockerfile`

### 3. Deploy
Railway will automatically deploy when you push to the configured branch, or you can manually trigger a deployment from the dashboard.

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify the following:

### ‚úì Build Phase
- [ ] Dependencies installed successfully
- [ ] Prisma client generated (check for "Prisma schema loaded" in logs)
- [ ] TypeScript compilation completed
- [ ] Build validation passed
- [ ] Docker image created

### ‚úì Runtime Phase
- [ ] Container started successfully
- [ ] Environment validation passed (no "‚ùå Environment validation failed" errors)
- [ ] Services initialized ("‚úÖ Services initialized successfully")
- [ ] Server listening on port (should see "üì° Server: http://0.0.0.0:3000")

### ‚úì Health Check
Test the health endpoint:
```bash
curl https://your-service.railway.app/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 45.123,
  "environment": "production",
  "port": 3000
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "Prisma client not generated"
**Solution:** Ensure `DATABASE_URL` is set in Railway environment variables. Railway will pass it as a build argument.

### Service crashes on startup with "Environment validation failed"
**Solution:** Check Railway logs for specific missing variables. Add them in the Variables tab.

### Health check times out
**Solution:** 
1. Check Railway logs for actual startup errors
2. Verify the service is binding to `0.0.0.0:$PORT`
3. Healthcheck timeout is now 300s, should be sufficient

### "Cannot find module '@wirecrest/...'"
**Solution:**
1. Verify Dockerfile copies all workspace packages
2. Check that turbo build ran successfully in build logs
3. Ensure Root Directory is set to `/` (monorepo root)

### Module version mismatch errors
**Solution:** Clear Railway build cache and redeploy:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí General
2. Find "Clear Build Cache"
3. Trigger a new deployment

## Success Indicators

Your deployment is successful when you see:

```
üîß Initializing services...
‚úÖ Services initialized successfully
üöÄ Scraper Service Started
üì° Server: http://0.0.0.0:3000
üîó Webhook Base URL: https://your-service.railway.app
üìä Health Check: http://0.0.0.0:3000/health
üéØ Stripe Webhook: https://your-service.railway.app/webhooks/stripe
üéØ Apify Webhook: https://your-service.railway.app/webhooks/apify

‚úÖ Ready to receive webhooks
```

## Next Steps

1. Test webhook endpoints are accessible
2. Configure Stripe webhook URL in Stripe dashboard
3. Configure Apify webhooks to point to your Railway URL
4. Monitor Railway logs for any runtime errors
5. Set up monitoring/alerting if needed

## Support

If issues persist after following this guide:
1. Check Railway deployment logs for specific errors
2. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
3. Ensure the main branch has all the latest changes
4. Try clearing Railway's build cache and redeploying
