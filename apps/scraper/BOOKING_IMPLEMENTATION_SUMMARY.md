SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_key

- `BookingBusinessProfile`
- `BookingReview`
- `BookingOverview`
- `BookingRoom`
- `BookingFacility`
- And all supporting tables...

## üîÑ Integration with Existing System

The Booking.com implementation follows the exact same patterns as Google, Facebook, and TripAdvisor:

1. **Same Actor Management System** - Uses your existing `ActorManager` with memory-aware scheduling
2. **Same Task Tracking** - Integrates with `BusinessTaskTracker` for progress monitoring
3. **Same Sentiment Analysis** - Uses your existing `SentimentAnalyzer`
4. **Same Database Patterns** - Follows the established service architecture
5. **Same API Patterns** - Consistent with other platform endpoints

## üéØ Next Steps

To complete the integration:

1. **Add Database Methods** - Implement the Booking.com-specific database methods in `DatabaseService`
2. **Run Database Migrations** - Add the new tables to your Supabase database
3. **Test the Integration** - Use the API endpoints to verify functionality
4. **Connect to Frontend** - Add Booking.com support to your reputation dashboard UI
