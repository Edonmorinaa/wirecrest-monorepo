# Scraper Refactoring Notes

## Completed Refactorings (Current Session)

### 1. Centralized Review Analysis Service ✅

**Problem**: The `analyzeReview` function was duplicated across 6+ files with slight variations in logic.

**Solution**: Created a centralized `ReviewAnalysisService` at `src/services/analysis/ReviewAnalysisService.ts`

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth for sentiment analysis
- Consistent keyword extraction across all platforms
- Standardized urgency scoring (1-10 scale)
- Easy to maintain and update analysis logic
- Reduced code duplication by ~500 lines

**Files Updated**:
- ✅ `src/services/analysis/ReviewAnalysisService.ts` (NEW - centralized service)
- ✅ `src/supabase/database.ts` (removed duplicate logic, now uses centralized service)
- ✅ `src/apifyService/actors/googleBusinessReviewsActor.ts` (removed duplicate logic)
- ✅ `src/apifyService/actors/facebookBusinessReviewsActor.ts` (removed duplicate logic, now uses centralized service)
- ✅ `src/apifyService/actors/tripAdvisorBusinessReviewsActor.ts` (removed duplicate logic, now uses centralized service)

### 2. Removed Duplicate Database Implementations ✅

**Problem**: Three database implementations existed with overlapping functionality:
- `database.ts` (Prisma - active)
- `database-supabase-backup.ts` (1676 lines - legacy)
- `database-prisma.ts` (duplicate)

**Solution**: Deleted legacy/duplicate files, keeping only `database.ts` as the single source of truth.

**Files Deleted**:
- ✅ `src/supabase/database-supabase-backup.ts`
- ✅ `src/supabase/database-prisma.ts`
- ✅ `src/core/old-index.ts`

**Benefits**:
- No more confusion about which implementation to use
- Bugs only need to be fixed in one place
- Reduced maintenance burden
- Clearer codebase structure

## Known Issues / Future Work

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Missing Database Methods for Facebook & TripAdvisor

**Issue**: The current `database.ts` (Prisma-based) only has `saveGoogleReviewsWithMetadata`. The following methods are missing:
- `saveFacebookReviewsWithMetadata` (called by `facebookBusinessReviewsActor.ts` line 348)
- `saveTripAdvisorReviewsWithMetadata` (may be called by `tripAdvisorBusinessReviewsActor.ts`)

**Root Cause**: The database was migrated from Supabase to Prisma, but only Google review methods were implemented. The backup file (`database-supabase-backup.ts`) that contained these methods was deleted during this cleanup.

**Impact**: 
- ❌ Facebook review scraping will fail at the save step
- ❌ TripAdvisor review scraping will fail at the save step
- ✅ Google review scraping works correctly

**Immediate Action Required**:
1. Implement `saveFacebookReviewsWithMetadata` in `database.ts` using Prisma
2. Implement `saveTripAdvisorReviewsWithMetadata` in `database.ts` using Prisma
3. Implement `saveBookingReviewsWithMetadata` in `database.ts` using Prisma
4. Test all platforms to ensure data saving works

**Recommendation**: 
- Reference the logic from the deleted `database-supabase-backup.ts` (may need to restore from git)
- Convert Supabase client calls to Prisma queries
- Ensure metadata relationships are handled correctly
- Add the centralized `reviewAnalysisService` calls to these new methods

### 1. Dual Service Architecture (INCOMPLETE SOLID REFACTOR)

**Issue**: Two separate service layers exist:
- `src/services/` - Current production services
- `src/core/services/` - SOLID-compliant services (incomplete migration)

**Status**: The SOLID refactor in `src/core/` was started but never completed. The README suggests a 4-phase migration that was never finished.

**Recommendation**: 
- Option A: Complete the SOLID refactor and migrate all services
- Option B: Remove the incomplete `src/core/` implementation and keep existing services
- Option C: Gradually migrate on a per-service basis

**Note**: This should be addressed in a separate, focused refactoring session.

### 2. Actor File Organization

**Issue**: Actor files have inconsistent patterns:
- Some have dedicated Job classes, others don't
- Memory allocation logic varies
- Some embed business logic that should be in services

**Recommendation**: Standardize actor patterns across all platforms.

### 3. Analytics Services

**Issue**: Each platform has its own analytics service with similar logic:
- `googleReviewAnalyticsService.ts`
- `facebookReviewAnalyticsService.ts`
- `tripAdvisorReviewAnalyticsService.ts`
- `bookingReviewAnalyticsService.ts`

**Recommendation**: Consider creating a base analytics service with platform-specific extensions.

## Architecture Decisions

### Review Analysis Service Design

The centralized `ReviewAnalysisService` was designed as a singleton with the following features:

1. **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures only one instance exists across the application
2. **Consistent Constants**: `COMMON_WORDS` and `BUSINESS_TERMS` centralized
3. **TF-IDF-like Keyword Extraction**: Importance scoring with business term boosting
4. **Emotional State Detection**: Combines sentiment score with keyword analysis
5. **Urgency Scoring**: 1-10 scale based on rating, sentiment, and keywords
6. **Batch Processing**: Supports analyzing multiple reviews efficiently

### Database Service Consolidation

The `database.ts` file now:
- Uses Prisma exclusively (no Supabase client)
- Delegates review analysis to `ReviewAnalysisService`
- Maintains clear separation of concerns
- Has consistent error handling

## Testing Recommendations

After these changes, the following should be tested:

1. **Review Scraping**: Ensure all platforms can still scrape and save reviews
   - Google Maps
   - Facebook
   - TripAdvisor
   - Booking.com

2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Verify sentiment scores are consistent
   - Check keyword extraction works correctly
   - Verify urgency scoring is appropriate
   - Test emotional state detection

3. **Database Operations**: Ensure no regressions in data saving
   - New reviews are saved correctly
   - Existing reviews are updated properly
   - Metadata is linked correctly

## Migration Impact

### Low Risk ✅
- Review analysis consolidation (logic is identical, just centralized)
- Removing unused legacy files (no active imports)

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Database service changes (all calls updated, but needs testing)

### Not Changed (Safe) ✅
- API endpoints remain unchanged
- Webhook handlers remain unchanged
- Scheduling logic remains unchanged
- Analytics calculations remain unchanged

## Next Steps

1. Run full test suite to verify no regressions
2. Monitor production logs for any errors
3. Decide on SOLID refactor strategy (complete vs remove vs gradually migrate)
4. Consider creating base analytics service
5. Standardize actor patterns across platforms
